I am a Research Scientist Lead at Criteo AI Lab, where I focus on advancing the fields of Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, and Fair ML. Previously, I served as an Associate Professor at Universit√© de Lille, where I also completed my HDR in Computer Science. PhD from University of Paris Saclay.

Trying to do science within the LLM craziness.

## Research Interests

I currently focus on **Foundation models for recommender systems & 3d vision**

Yet, my research insterest spans several areas in machine learning and artificial intelligence:

* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Developing novel architectures and methods for complex learning tasks
* **Fair Machine Learning**: Working on approaches to ensure AI systems are equitable and unbiased
* **Recommender Systems**: Creating advanced algorithms for personalized recommendations
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring decision-making processes in autonomous systems
* **Computer Vision**: Investigating visual processing and understanding


## Recent Work

Some of my notable contributions include:

* **Visual Processing & Language**: Published groundbreaking work on modulating early visual processing through language (NeurIPS 2017)
* **Recommender Systems**: Developed innovative approaches using autoencoders for recommendation tasks
* **Fair ML**: Advanced the field of fairness-aware learning for continuous attributes and treatments (ICML 2019)
